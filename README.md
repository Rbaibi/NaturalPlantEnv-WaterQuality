# Natural Plant Environment and Water Quality

Mothership Coder Mission 2: [Living Environment Challenges](https://www.space4good.com/coder-missions/)

## Problem Definition
There is no accurate evaluation of the current situation and state of natural plant environment, forests, grass fields, and water resources quality and quantity. More information is needed to be able to define and develop policies and to predict the risk factors associated with the above mentioned areas.

## Example research questions
- Which farms have alarming problems with both land subsidence in peat meadows and saltwater seepage such as [Polder Middelburg](https://www.zuid-holland.nl/onderwerpen/ruimte/bodem-ondergrond/polder-middelburg/)? How can an integrated [eco-agri-tourism](https://www.zuid-holland.nl/onderwerpen/landschap/projecten-rijke/groen-index/groenprojecten/krimpenerwaard/) plan for polders or other business [ideas](https://www.zuid-holland.nl/actueel/nieuws/februari-2019/nieuwe/) can help at this problem by integrating nature, cows and experience. 

- How adequate is the natural plant environment of PZH in terms of food for pollinizers? How policymakers make a ‘bee friendly province’ mixing species of trees and flowers along roads, dikes and herbaceous rich farmlands for bees? See [national bee strategy](https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/reports/2018/02/02/nl-pollinator-strategy-bed--breakfast-for-bees/DEF+webversie+Nat+Bijenstrategie+ENG_jan+2018.PDF) with PZH as partner.

#### Others
- Are there areas with abnormal quality or quantity of irrigation? How are the weather conditions affecting this throughout the year?
- Are there areas with problematic natural plant or animal quantity?
- Can we evaluate the quality of soil in different areas? 

## Deliverables
The participating team is asked to conduct the necessary research and build a prototype of a system able to:

- Investigate the suggested research questions or any additional ones of your choice.
- Find patterns in the historical and real-time data
- Simulate alternative future scenarios (trade-off analysis) and identify environmental and societal risks
- Calculate the financial projections of the various simulated scenarios for the local government
- Deliver a report on the findings and recommendations for future research and potential policies 

## Stakeholders
- Local and national governments
- Farmers and farm produce consumers
- Forest Rangers and Park management
- Pollinators and Animal preservation organizations
- Maintenance of natural sights
